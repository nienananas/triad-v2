[SUMMARY]
Simulate goto in NVECSimulator
[DESCRIPTION]
When given a goto command the _NVECSimulator_ shall compute the next coordinate based upon the normal vector and altitude of the current position and the normal vector and altitude of the destination. The simulator shall move the UAV with infinite acceleration and use numerical methods to hone in on the next coordinate which will be {{SIMULATION_STEP_SIZE}} meters from the current position along the travel path.
